# Designs-Viewer
#### this is a very simple way to automatically show users & clients your designs. 
#### you dont' have to understand anything about php. just put your designs inside a folder in (./designs/) directory. 

- the folder name will work as a : menu list name
- the design-folder name will work as a : menu item

<strong>there is another thing: same idea implies to external websites that allow this. </strong></h3>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">(notice that: many websites don't allow putting their website inside an iframe) </span>

here's is a life demo: <a href="http://ahmed-badawy.com/projects/Designs-Viewer/websites.php" target="_blank">Design-Viewer (external websites)</a>
you can populate this with the websites of your needs. just edit the array in the begining of the file (websites.php)
you will find the code in the same repo...
